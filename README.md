<b>Diabetes Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)<b>
<br>
Overview<br>
This project implements a simple machine learning system that predicts whether a person has diabetes and classifies the type of diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
<br>
The system takes medical input values from the user, processes them with models trained on historical diabetes data, and outputs the diagnosis.
<br>
Features<br>
Detects if a person is diabetic or not.
<br>
Classifies diabetes type if diagnosed positive.
<br>
Uses real-world diabetes dataset from Plotly.
<br>
User-friendly command-line interface to enter medical data.
<br>
Dataset<br>
The dataset is sourced from Plotly's Diabetes Dataset.<br>
Note: Diabetes type labels are simulated for demo purposes based on age and insulin levels.
